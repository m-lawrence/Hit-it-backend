# Hit It

Hit It is an app designed to help independent musicians plan and organize their tours. A user (band/musician) can sign in with their email and password. They will land on their profile page which features their band information and a list of their tours (past, present, and furture) and they also have the ability to create new tours. Within those tours, users are able to add, edit, or delete shows and show information. On the venue page, users are able to search for venues based on location and filter those venues based on venue type. This page features a map with icons indicating individual venues. The icons are clickable and feature a pop up which gives some venue information. On the bands page, users can search for bands based on location and can be directed to that band's profile page to find more information about the band. Finally, the calls page allows users to 'make a call', or advertise that they need help booking a show in a given location. Alternately, it also allows users to view calls in their location that they may want to respond to.
